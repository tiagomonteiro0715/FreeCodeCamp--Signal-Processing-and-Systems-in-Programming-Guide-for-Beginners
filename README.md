My FreeCodeCamp page [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/tiagomonteiro/)

Here you can find the code I use in my freecodecamp news articles: [link](https://github.com/tiagomonteiro0715/freecodecamp-my-articles-source-code/tree/main)

And here is the github repository to the python and latex code of my book: [The Math Behind Artificial Intelligence A Guide to AI Foundations](https://github.com/tiagomonteiro0715/The-Math-Behind-Artificial-Intelligence-A-Guide-to-AI-Foundations/tree/main)

[Here](https://ray.so/) is the site I use to create the code images.
